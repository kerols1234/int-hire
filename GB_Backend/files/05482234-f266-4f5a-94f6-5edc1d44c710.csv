ISTJ,"they are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do, ISTJs are steady, productive contributors. Although they are Introverted, ISTJs are rarely isolated; typical ISTJs know just where they belong in life, and want to understand how they can participate in established organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and making sure that standards are met.","hey rely on their past experience to guide them, and are most comfortable in familiar surroundings. ISTJs trust the proven method, and appreciate the value of dedicated practice to build confidence in their skills.
ISTJs are hardworking and will persist until a task is done. They are logical and methodical, and often enjoy tasks that require them to use step-by-step reasoning to solve a problem."," Perseverance: The ISTJ’s main and most admirable strength is ; people of this type simply do not give up. This trait is advantageous to them and can be that which sets them apart in their careers. Their peers and competitors may possess greater skills, but few will match the ISTJ in dogged commitment. 

 Planning: Because of the ISTJ’s Judging component, people of this type have a very clear command of time and priorities. They are quite skilled in planning, organizing, mapping out schedules and following agendas. They excel in time management, are punctual (and demand the same of others) and consistently meet their deadlines.

 Detail orientation: ISTJs notice holes, gaps, errors that broader thinkers don’t. They like facts, details and numbers without the emotional or interpretive fluff. And they don’t take facts or information for granted, nor do they rely on it simply because someone else said so. They will check things out for themselves, meticulously.

 Loyalty: ISTJs also have a natural instinct to protect and defend. Loyal, reliable and committed, these are people that can be depended on to guard everything from their families to our nation and these are responsibilities they proudly assume. To the institutions, organizations and people to which they are committed, they are unwavering in their service. ","Stubborness. While ISTJs will be admired for their unwavering commitment to their duty and their sense of what is right and proper, the down side of this is that they can be stubborn, inflexible and dogmatic. They often believe there is one right way (theirs) and things must be done that way. Everything else is, by default, wrong.

Tactlessness.The ISTJ's fierce commitment to truth can also get them in trouble in interpersonal dealings. They tend to speak without much consideration for the feelings of others, thinking it is always more important to be truthful than to make people feel good. They may even experience internal conflict around trying to be tactful or diplomatic, sensing that they are not being completely honest, direct or straightforward.

Guilt. ISTJs take their work, their commitments and really all aspects of their lives quite seriously and they work hard to plan well and to make wise decisions. When things don’t go as planned, however, they may blame and beat themselves up about it, second guess their decisions and suffer guilt. They will have a hard time simply accepting that sometimes life doesn’t go as planned, and will feel a sense of personal failure and defeat. This can be a source of stress and on-going rumination.

Resistance to change. ISTJs, in their drive to uphold tradition and do things by the book, can be resistant to change and innovation. Suspicious of new advances and ways of doing things, not only do they experience strain when called upon to embrace change, they also often stifle creativity or fail to appreciate the benefit of approaching old problems in new ways. This can limit their potential and make them seem especially difficult and stodgy to their coworkers and subordinates.","Question the procedure. Just because it’s “the way it has always been done” doesn’t mean it is the best or the only way. ISTJs find comfort in coasting along following the manner in which things have always been done. However, this can mean missed opportunities for growth and development, both personally and professionally. ISTJs will benefit by a willingness to break out of the rut of tradition. It certainly isn’t necessary to reinvent the wheel or fix what isn’t broken, but being willing to at least examine and question is essential. 

Question the rules. Their refusal to break the rules, while admirable in some respects, can be unwise. Not all rules are just or efficient, and guidelines aren’t all carved in stone. While respect for authority and laws is generally a good thing, it is the duty of society to actively consider and question and, in doing so, serve as a check on authorities and their exercise of power.

Be spontaneous. ISTJs have a strong internal sense of time management. While this is one of the mechanisms that enables them to work hard and meet deadlines, it can also be imprisoning. The ISTJ should experiment with not setting a schedule for the day and letting life happen naturally, or try surprising his or her spouse with an unplanned date.

Get in touch with their feelings. ISTJs, in order to develop and become better-rounded individuals, may need to exert some effort in the emotions department. This will benefit them both in their personal and professional lives. Working to understand and express their own feelings will help to deepen and enliven their friendships and other primary relationships. ",THE INSPECTOR,"ISTJs take deadlines and specifications very seriously, and work independently and systematically to complete the tasks they are given. ISTJs value a stable work environment with clear expectations and few surprises. They are at their best when they can create detailed plans of action and follow them with little deviation.

Although ISTJs may like to do quite a bit of their work independently, they often appreciate the value of participating on a team as well, especially if their colleagues are reasonable and businesslike and there is a clear hierarchy so that they know who is in charge.","ISTP

INFJ,"Creative and dedicated, they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges.

The Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others' emotions and motivations, and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself. They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people. Although they are sensitive, they are also reserved; the INFJ is a private sort, and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings.","INFJs are guided by a deeply considered set of personal values. They are intensely idealistic, and can clearly imagine a happier and more perfect future. They can become discouraged by the harsh realities of the present, but they are typically motivated and persistent in taking positive action nonetheless. The INFJ feels an intrinsic drive to do what they can to make the world a better place.

INFJs want a meaningful life and deep connections with other people. They do not tend to share themselves freely but appreciate emotional intimacy with a select, committed few. Although their rich inner life can sometimes make them seem mysterious or private to others, they profoundly value authentic connections with people they trust.","Practical insight. Some people are visionaries while others are down-to-earth problem solvers, but INFJs manage to straddle the line between both identities—and they usually succeed masterfully. INFJs are insightful thinkers who see through situations and people effectively and enjoy developing practical strategies for action. 

Compassion. As a Feeling type, you might expect an INFJ to show compassion—but what sets them apart is that their empathy comes with a sharp intuitive edge. They are quick to recognize worry and unhappiness in friends and loved ones, even when outward signs of distress are not visible to others. INFJs are uniquely capable of detecting unspoken and unacknowledged suffering, and are called into action by their instinctive ability to see beneath the surface.

Keeping the peace. Mediating disputes is hard work, but INFJs have an astounding ability to help heal the rifts that divide people. They intuitively sense the real suffering that anger can cause if left to fester, and because they are good listeners they are quite effective at helping warring parties find workable solutions that will satisfy the needs of all. And they do it with great energy and determination.

Decisiveness. For INFJs, obstacles exist to be overcome and no problem can outmatch the strength and resilience that these types possess deep inside. INFJs follow through on their ideas with conviction, and have the willpower and decisiveness necessary to see projects through to the end. INFJs live for the opportunity to solve problems and bring about positive change in the world.","Overlooking details. No matter how practically-oriented they aspire to be, INFJs have a tendency to get so caught up in theorizing the big picture that they forget to account for some of the precious details that can separate success from failure. Details always matter, and while INFJs may recognize this in principle, in practice they aren’t always as diligent about the small stuff as they should be. 

Intensely private. Despite their loving and sensitive natures, INFJs have a tendency to close themselves off from the world and don’t give people the chance to know them or see the wonderful qualities they possess. Even in their relations with family and trusted friends, INFJs can be enigmatic. When they are feeling frustrated or introspective, they may retreat from social contact without so much as a word of explanation, which can throw others for a loop.

Conflict averse. INFJs dislike conflict intensely and will usually intervene to stop it, but this is one area where their perspective can get distorted. INFJs often fail to recognize that conflict can actually serve a useful purpose, allowing a good process of give-and-take to be established and giving all parties the opportunity to resolve their problem forever. INFJs would be wise to acknowledge the value of open and honest dialogue, instead of automatically assuming that all squabbling is harmful.

Sensitive. Once an INFJ has made up their mind, they tend to be very confident in their conclusions and may not have much tolerance for those who continue to dissent. When someone challenges their conclusions, they can react very strongly and are especially vulnerable to criticism.","Question their intuition. INFJs have outstanding instincts for the most part, but sometimes their intuition betrays them when they are dealing with others. When something is bothering them, INFJs will often withdraw into the safety of their own heads rather than speaking openly about what they are feeling; conversely, they seldom express their feelings of love, affection and appreciation as directly as might be expected given the depth of the emotions they experience. To improve their communication habits, INFJs should go out of their way to share their feelings—both good and bad—with others regardless of how uncomfortable it makes them feel to do so. 

Give others the benefit of the doubt. INFJs are insightful, instinctive and persuasive. But despite the enormous effort that INFJs invest in developing and selling their concepts and ideas, sometimes dissidents will remain. INFJs sometimes become disenchanted with those who refuse to accept their conclusions, and they will convince themselves that their opponents have hidden agendas and are acting in bad faith. When situations like this arise, INFJs should try to accept that total consensus is impossible and that some will continue to hold contrary viewpoints. In situations like this, both sides should simply agree to disagree and move on. 

Let others agree to disagree, too. When tensions are high and arguments are heated, INFJs will do all they can to restore lost cohesion and tranquility. But their love of harmony and aversion to division is so powerful that INFJs refuse to accept that sometimes the best way to end disputes is to bring them out into the open, where bridges of understanding can be built. On balance, INFJs’ dislike of conflict is a good thing. But their efforts to play peacemaker might be more successful if they would concentrate on keeping the lines of communication open when disagreements arise instead of always trying to sweep everything under the rug. 

Make connections with extraverts. Because sharing with anyone outside a small trusted circle goes against their instincts, too often talented INFJs choose to keep their gifts wrapped up and hidden even though they have much to contribute. But INFJs would benefit by cultivating friendly relationships with extraverted people whenever possible. Opposites attract, and there is no doubt that being around more naturally open and communicative people can help bring INFJs out of their shells and out into the world where others can benefit from their intellect, empathy and compassion. 

Slow down! INFJs are productive and effective when they make a concerted effort to focus on one project at a time. But their fertile imaginations frequently undermine their efforts to stay on the straight and narrow, and they will often start new projects based on fresh inspirations before old ones are finished—and, before they know it, they will find themselves buried under an avalanche of work. There is really nothing INFJs can do to moderate the pace of their inspirations, but if they constantly remind themselves to slow down and take things one at a time, they may be able to resist the urge to go off on tangents at least some of the time.",THE COUNSELOR,"At work, the INFJ is focused on the task of bettering the human condition. INFJs are dedicated, helpful, and principled workers who can be relied on to envision, plan, and carry out complex projects for humanitarian causes.

Although they are typically driven by lofty ideals, Counselors gain the most satisfaction from their work when they can turn their ideas into reality, creating constructive change for other people.

INFJs are typically organized and prefer work that allows them to complete projects in an orderly manner. They are often independent and tend to prefer a quiet environment that allows them the opportunity to fully develop their own thoughts and ideas.

The ideal work environment for an INFJ is harmonious, industrious, and oriented to a humanitarian mission, with co-workers who are similarly committed to positive change. The ideal job for a Counselor allows them to use their creativity in an independent, organized environment to develop and implement a vision that is consistent with their personal values.","ISFJ

INTJ,"INTJs are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. They have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in themselves.

Often intellectual, INTJs enjoy logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. They approach life by analyzing the theory behind what they see, and are typically focused inward, on their own thoughtful study of the world around them. INTJs are drawn to logical systems and are much less comfortable with the unpredictable nature of other people and their emotions. They are typically independent and selective about their relationships, preferring to associate with people who they find intellectually stimulating.","INTJs are perceptive about systems and strategy, and often understand the world as a chess board to be navigated. They want to understand how systems work, and how events proceed: the INTJ often has a unique ability to foresee logical outcomes. They enjoy applying themselves to a project or idea in depth, and putting in concentrated effort to achieve their goals.

INTJs have a hunger for knowledge and strive to constantly increase their competence; they are often perfectionists with extremely high standards of performance for themselves and others. They tend to have a keen interest in self-improvement and are lifelong learners, always looking to add to their base of information and awareness.","Strategy. INTJs not only see the plan or course of action, they are ready and prepared with several back-ups depending on the various circumstances that could possibly arise. With their expansive, future-focused vision for seeing possibilities and recognizing potential, they are also detailed and logical enough to see holes, gaps and inconsistencies. 

Innovation. Though the INTJ may outwardly appear intractable, as a type they are actually quite receptive to and supportive of change and innovation, and this open approach helps to enhance their problem-solving savvy. They believe that most people, processes and systems have the potential to be improved upon and they will seek new and creative ways to try to bring about that change.

Determination. INTJs are revered for their bravery and steadfastness in the face of challenge. They are characteristically determined in whatever they are doing, even to the point of relentless, and are not afraid to move in to tackle the really difficult challenges. Rather than feeling daunted or frustrated, this excites and exhilarates them. They trust their judgment and are confident in their ability to solve the problems and overcome the challenges they encounter in their personal or professional lives.

Willingness to Learn. INTJs aren’t only looking to change externals and other people. They are also diligently committed to working on themselves. Though they won’t typically dwell long upon their feelings and emotional state, they are fully engaged in the work of self-improvement. They are lifelong learners and will always be looking for ways to increase their knowledge and skills.","Superiority. The INTJ’s prowess in the area of intellect, logic and reason is unarguable and definitely among their chief strengths, as is their confidence in their ideas. However, these strengths can turn into weaknesses when they morph into a superiority complex. Unfortunately, among INTJs, this is not uncommon. They may be arrogant and condescending, as well as impatient with people who don’t catch on as quickly as they’d like. With those who demonstrate less ability to think logically and rationally, they may be particularly judgmental and intolerant.

Emotional Distance. INTJs are also known for their low EQ and unwillingness to engage the emotions—their own or others. Preferring to conceptualize the world on a logical, rational basis, they tend to have little patience for emotional concerns. They struggle to pick up on and respond to the emotional cues and needs of others. This can stifle interpersonal relationships, as well as their own growth and development, and may end up keeping others at (at least) arm’s distance.

Perfectionism. While the meticulousness of the INTJ can be a strength, as in all things, too much of a strength can easily become a weakness, and for the INTJ, this natural fastidiousness quickly becomes perfectionism, and in this they can be quite fierce and painstaking. Their standards in general are exacting and this critique may be directed not only toward themselves, but toward others as well. 

Imbalance. The INTJ places a high priority on work and will be quite devoted to his or her professional life. But this comes at a price, namely in time that might be spent on family, other relationships and leisure. It is easy for the INTJ to find him or herself with misplaced priorities and, as a result, relational problems. While their drive to succeed professionally can certainly pay off, it can take a toll on the rest of their lives.","Go outside of themselves. INTJs are internal processors and accustomed to finding the right answers or the best plans within their own minds. However, such a constant internal focus can mean the INTJ may miss important details, as well as the potentially insightful and helpful contributions of others. To improve their own ideas and plans, INTJs should seek input from friends, family and colleagues. Though the INTJ has full confidence in his or her own abilities, conferencing with others can breathe new life into a stale approach and can help to uncover blind spots. 

Go inside. INTJs don’t naturally introspect deeply or spend much time considering their emotional state. They focus internally on their many ideas and abstract concepts, but when it comes to looking at themselves and their feelings, they often avoid the activity. Out of touch with their own blind spots and character defects, INTJs can be quick to find fault with others. One solution is to work on cultivating humility and compassion.

Balance. It is easy for the INTJ to become completely consumed with work or some project or plan that he or she has devised. In the moment, this will feel exhilarating for the individual, but may have consequences for personal wellbeing and relationships in the long run. The INTJ should strive for better work-life balance. That also means, as mentioned, taking time to examine his or her emotions and responses. It won’t come naturally, but will help interpersonal relationships immensely. 

Pick their battles. It is not necessary to argue every single point, though the INTJ’s Thinking nature will compel him or her to do so. This is the default response of their perfectionistic hyper-logical nature. Thus, to better navigate all areas of life, the individual may need to understand that sometimes you have to let the small things go so you can accomplish the big things in the long run. 

If it ain’t broke…and even if it is. The INTJ may need to resist the desire to be continually improving and changing. Their view on potential and possibilities for all products, systems and people, leads them to want to always be fixing and “improving.” What they may not realize is that not all people want to be fixed and not all companies want greater efficiency. ",THE MASTERMIND,"At work, the INTJ excels at creating and implementing innovative solutions to analytical problems. They naturally see possibilities for improvement within complex systems and are organized and determined in implementing their ideas for change.

INTJs are comfortable with abstraction and theory but gain the most satisfaction from turning their ideas into reality. They often enjoy working independently or with a small team, taking measured, strategic steps to implement change.

INTJs enjoy working with logical systems that they can understand in depth. They enjoy the challenge of comprehending complex ideas, and want to understand how they can improve the way things work.

The ideal work environment for an INTJ is logical, efficient, structured, and analytical, with colleagues that are competent, intelligent, and productive. The ideal job for a Mastermind allows them to use their analytical skills to problem-solve in a challenging environment, and to take responsibility for implementing their ideas to create efficient, innovative systems.","ISTJ

ISTP,"ISTPs are observant artisans with an understanding of mechanics and an interest in troubleshooting. They approach their environments with a flexible logic, looking for practical solutions to the problems at hand. They are independent and adaptable, and typically interact with the world around them in a self-directed, spontaneous manner.

ISTPs are attentive to details and responsive to the demands of the world around them. Because of their astute sense of their environment, they are good at moving quickly and responding to emergencies. ISTPs are reserved, but not withdrawn: the ISTP enjoys taking action, and approaches the world with a keen appreciation for the physical and sensory experiences it has to offer.","ISTPs are curious about the mechanics of the world around them and typically have a unique ability to manipulate the tools in their environments. They tend to study how things work and often achieve mastery in the use and operation of machines, instruments, and equipment. They seek understanding, but in a practical sense: they like to be able to put their technical knowledge to immediate use and are quickly bored by theory.

ISTPs tend to be detached and prefer the logic of mechanical things to the complexity of human emotions. Independent and reserved, ISTPs treasure their personal space, and want to be free to be spontaneous and follow their own lead. ISTPs are selective about their relationships, and appreciate others who allow them plenty of freedom to do their own thing.","Practical and creative. The strength of the ISTP is frequently seen in their technical and mechanical skills, from the tuning of a bicycle to the firing of a gun to the repair of a Formula One race car. ISTPs are masterful in their use of tools and their ability to fix, repair and make tools and machines work for them. They are also particularly handy around the house and can fix most anything, putting ideas into motion with their hands.  

Problem solving. ISTPs excel in problem solving because they are able to absorb large quantities of sensory information and categorize it effectively and efficiently so it is ready to be called upon when needed, even in the heat of a stressful moment. Confident in their knowledge and their abilities, they are the doers in any emergency, ready to dive in and take action. They don’t sit on the sidelines paralyzed by the stress, they move into it. 

Common sense and world savvy. The one thing ISTPs will never be called is gullible, as this type possesses a keen ability to accurately size up the character and motives of others with striking reliability. People are unlikely to pull one over on them, but if they do, ISTPs will be quite distraught over it, not understanding how they might have been duped. 

Flexible. ISTPs do particularly well in physical endeavors of various types because they are able to insightfully size up their competition and position themselves properly in order to secure the victory. Flexible and adaptable, they improvise quickly in order to respond to the situation, trusting that their bodies and the instincts will guide them.","Insensitive. ISTPs tend toward blunt and unsweetened communication and in many ways this can be a strength because it means they are honest, direct and logical. But in excess, it becomes quite harsh and critical, especially if people don’t meet the ISTP’s standards of what constitutes logic, reason or practicality. Rather than accepting that people simply think differently, the ISTP can become irritated when made to deal with a way of thinking that is not natural for them. 

Risk-seeking behavior. The ISTP’s restlessness, tendency to become bored and constant pursuit of the thrill can lead them to pursue risky and even reckless behaviors, not fully weighing the costs of their actions. While hedonism is a natural tendency of the ISTPs, some are particularly unwise in their quest for pleasure, thrills, the adrenaline rush and instant gratification, claiming “you only live once.” 

Impatient. ISTPs don’t deal well with the inability to move forward, make a decision or act in the moment. Waiting and deliberating is the much greater challenge. Their inability to be patient and their aversion to being bored can fuel their impulsiveness and hedonism in unhealthy ways as they seek their adrenaline fix. 

Private and reserved. ISTPs have a strong need for personal space and solitude. In and of itself, this preference need not be classified as a weakness, though problems arise when this need dominates and causes them to push others away or avoid intimacy. They can be inordinately protective of their space, their solitude, their schedule and their way of doing things and, like a mama bear, can become quite defensive toward those who seek to move into this space without permission. ","Make a plan. ISTPs are known for their tendency to avoid long-range planning, preferring to make decisions in the moment and live in the present. This means they often fail to take the steps that can help them to advance in their careers and other areas of life. While the ISTP doesn’t need to take their plan and etch it in stone, it helps to have a general framework in order to make decisions and take the steps that can better facilitate a successful career path. Work on setting goals, making commitments and long-range planning. 

Balance opportunism. ISTPs inherently understand how to position themselves, and work skillfully with the resources and advantages they have in order to succeed. They can, as a result, be exploitative and opportunistic. The ISTP needs to be mindful of his or her goals and motives to make sure that “taking advantage” doesn’t involve taking advantage of someone else. 

Learn time management skills. As Perceiving types, ISTPs prefer to let life come and determine the course of their day, rather than taking a proactive role in deciding how their time will be spent and what they will do. Effort spent on developing time management skills can help the ISTP gain better control of his or her time in order to actively prioritize and use this time rather than letting the needs of the day or the moment dictate. Better time management strategies can also help people of this type overcome their natural tendency to procrastinate.

Stop and reflect. ISTPs get easily caught up in the moment and engaged in the present situation, and once it’s over they’re on to the next. They spend their lives so externally focused that they often fail to set aside time for introspection, for reflection upon their actions and feelings or to learn from their mistakes. ISTPs develop as individuals when they will take a break in the action to spend a little time thinking about their lives, their feelings, where they are going, how they need to grow and what their next steps will be. 

Reframe commitment. In life, love and work, ISTPs are generally hesitant to make commitments. They live in the day and focus their energies in the present. As a result, it is difficult for them to conceive of where they will be or what they will want to be doing at some point in the future. To become people who commit successfully, ISTPs can begin to think of their commitments as a daily renewal. One need not declare what ten years from now will look like, it’s only necessary to reframe commitment in terms of many small, daily commitments that over time build up to something resembling a long-term achievment. ","THE CRAFTSMAN
","At work, the ISTP is motivated by a desire to achieve and utilize technical expertise. ISTPs enjoy mastering and manipulating the tools of their trade, whatever they may be: the traditional hammers and saws, or the more modern tools of business or technology.

ISTPs prefer tasks with a tangible result, and typically feel most satisfied when they have built something concrete. They enjoy troubleshooting and often look for occupations that allow them to apply their skills to solve practical problems.

Many ISTPs enjoy occupations that involve physical activity, often with an aspect of risk or danger, and dislike being stuck at a desk. They are most often energized by action, and want to jump in to get things done rather than spend much time planning or theorizing.

ISTPs value efficiency and logic, and want flexibility in their work. They prefer a job where they can be practical and action-oriented without being overly burdened by rules, procedure, or bureaucracy.","ISTP

INFP,"INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair.

INFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path. They enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same. INFPs are creative and often artistic; they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.","INFPs value authenticity and want to be original and individual in what they do. They are often concerned with a search for meaning and truth within themselves. Following tradition holds little appeal for the INFP; they prefer to do their own exploration of values and ideas, and decide for themselves what seems right. INFPs are often offbeat and unconventional, but they feel no desire to conform. The INFP would rather be true to themselves than try to fit in with the crowd.

INFPs are accepting and nonjudgmental in their treatment of others, believing that each person must follow their own path. They are flexible and accommodating, and can often see many points of view. It is important to the INFP to support other people; however, the INFP may react strongly if they feel their own values are being violated. They especially hate being steamrolled by people who insist there is one right way to do things. INFPs want an open, supportive exchange of ideas.","Idealism. INFPs care deeply for others and believe it is their duty to make a positive impact on the lives of other people in any way they can. Because of this unbreakable commitment, INFPs are capable of great self-sacrifice, and they won’t compromise their ethical standards for personal benefit. INFPs are firm believers in the unlimited potential of human beings to achieve remarkable things, and they can always be counted on to provide encouragement or material support to those who are attempting to expand their horizons.

Integrity. Integrity means everything to INFPs, and that includes intellectual as well as moral integrity. Some people might accuse INFPs of being overly imaginative or of being willing to stretch logic to the breaking point in order to find the deeper meaning they insist must exist, but there is no denying that the deeply reflective nature of INFPs allows them to transcend the boundaries of imagination that so often prevent us from discovering new solutions to old problems.

Compromise. As empathic idealists, harmonious relations are like a balm to the soul for INFPs. In family settings or when working in groups, INFPs are highly effective as mediators because they are legitimately interested in the viewpoints of all and will go out of their way to make sure that everyone is given a fair hearing. They are enthusiastic advocates of cooperation and believe that no difficulty is insurmountable when people work together for a common cause. 

Dedication. It is easy to pay lip service to virtues like compassion, creativity, originality and open- mindedness, but these ideas don’t mean much unless they can be translated into real-world applications. Fortunately, INFPs are masters at doing just that. Passionate and committed to the cause, these personalities have a unique ability to mold and shape their surrounding environment in ways that promote self- improvement and transcendent achievement for all. ","Sensitivity. Their deep compassion, sensitivity and commitment to originality allows INFPs to interface with their interpersonal landscapes in a constructive manner, but these feelings also leave them vulnerable to disillusionment and powerful existential angst. INFPs who venture enthusiastically out into the world can end up retreating into lethargy and depression when they discover their idealism isn’t always shared or respected by others, and their incredible talents can go completely to waste when they become too discouraged to continue.

Impracticality. While their insistence on standing up for justice and decency is admirable, the intensity of their feelings can occasionally leave INFPs unwilling to make compromises even when doing so might be necessary to get something accomplished. Sticking to your morals is admirable, but in the real world it may be impossible to accomplish anything unless the INFP can find a way to give and take a little and find practical, if imperfect, solutions to problems. 

Selflessness. INFPs have a tendency to neglect or suppress their own needs if they believe it is necessary to keep the peace or make others happy. When a person holds his or her insecurities inside for too long, it can eventually cause a blow-up or an emotional breakdown. Sensitive INFPs often suffer in silence, and this is a pity because INFPs and their fellow travelers usually have people in their lives who care about them a lot and would be more than happy to help them deal with their heartaches and disappointments. 

Vulnerability. Compassionate to the core, INFPs lead with their hearts rather than their heads and this can sometimes set them up for trouble. Unfortunately there are users and manipulators out there who are always on the lookout for easy targets, and from the standpoint of these individuals INFPS might as well have flashing neon signs attached to their foreheads that say “exploit me, exploit me!” Trust is a wonderful thing, but not when it makes you gullible. ","Learn to recognize the difference between compromise and concession. People who disagree with INFPs are simply seeing things from a different point of view, but to an INFP, it can feel like they are being backed into a corner. Instead of digging in their heels, INFPs must find a way to detach from the situation so they can comprehend the motivations of their opposition more clearly. If it is only a difference in values and not a lack of them that is responsible for divergent opinions, then INFPs should not expect others to give in to stubbornness any more than they would if the shoe were on the other foot.

Make sure dreams and fantasies are used to enhance reality rather than replace it. INFPs who look out at the world with idealistic eyes often see grand vistas of beauty and limitless possibility that others are not capable of perceiving. But INFPs sometimes choose to retreat into these fantasies instead of using them to solve real-world problems. Imagination can open the door to better possibilities, and INFPs should never lose sight of its transformative potential. 

Learn to respect the details. No matter how wonderfully inventive a new idea might be, it won’t get anywhere if the logistical details required to put it into practice are ignored or neglected. INFPs may find this aspect of the creative processes a bit boring, but they should challenge themselves to overcome their disinterest and pay attention to all those annoying details anyway. 

Seek out leadership positions. INFPs have strong egalitarian instincts, are natural conciliators, passionately believe in the utility of cooperation, are excellent listeners, and never fail to pay attention when someone has a new idea to share. These admirable qualities double as superb leadership skills, and no one who possesses them should avoid leadership positions simply because they aren’t extraverts. Above all else, leaders must have the respect of those they presume to lead, and INFPs are just as capable of gaining that respect as any other personality type. 

Accept themselves as they are without apology. Because their standards are so high, INFPs have a hard time forgiving themselves when they fail to meet their own expectations. They may also become indecisive and fall into a perfectionism so extreme that it cuts off their flow of creativity and makes it impossible for them to excel and achieve. This dynamic is unfortunate, especially as INFPs would never think of holding others to such impossible standards. For the sake of their mental health and happiness, INFPs must learn to stop comparing themselves to others and recognize that they should prioritize their own happiness.","THE HEALER
","At work, the INFP is not particularly driven by money or status, preferring work that aligns with their personal values and allows them to help others. INFPs are typically motivated by vision and inspiration, and want to engage with projects and causes that feel important to them.

INFPs enjoy the process of creative problem-solving, and want to understand complex issues. They appreciate innovation, and want to come up with original ideas to improve circumstances for people. An ideal job for a Healer allows them to express their individuality in the way they work, and takes advantage of their ability to see unique solutions.

INFPs enjoy working autonomously and having control over how and when to complete a project. They often enjoy participating in teams, although they want to be free to put their own personal stamp on their work. When they do work with other people, it's important to the INFP that they be cooperative, supportive, and flexible, and that they have similar passion for their ideals.","INTP

ISFP,"ISFPs are gentle caretakers who live in the present moment and enjoy their surroundings with cheerful, low-key enthusiasm. They are flexible and spontaneous, and like to go with the flow to enjoy what life has to offer. ISFPs are quiet and unassuming, and may be hard to get to know. However, to those who know them well, the ISFP is warm and friendly, eager to share in life's many experiences.

ISFPs have a strong aesthetic sense and seek out beauty in their surroundings. They are attuned to sensory experience, and often have a natural talent for the arts. ISFPs especially excel at manipulating objects, and may wield creative tools like paintbrushes and sculptor's knives with great mastery.","ISFPs tend to be tolerant and nonjudgmental, but are deeply loyal to the people and causes that matter to them. They endeavor to accept and support other people, but are ultimately guided by their own core values. They will typically look for ways to be accommodating and may have difficulty dealing with others who are not willing to do the same.

ISFPs are typically modest and may underestimate themselves. They usually do not like to be in the spotlight, preferring instead to take a supporting role, and will avoid planning and organizing whenever possible. Sensitive and responsive, they step in to do what needs to be done and are satisfied by their personal sense of being helpful to others.","Observant. ISFPs are super-observant and seldom overlook any details. However, what makes them so gifted as problem-solvers is that they know how to synthesize what they sense and experience into a coherent whole. ISFPs are experts at finding patterns and connections, and this ability allows them to see possibilities for change and improvement that others miss. Best of all, the advice they give and the solutions they recommend are always practical, sensible and capable of making any situation better in the present moment. 

Bold and spontaneous. Craving fun and excitement as they do, ISFPs know that life is short and that we must seize the moment before it passes us by. ISFPs live extremely active lives, boldly pursuing many hobbies and undertaking many exciting projects. They’re also spontaneous enough to leap at chances for new experiences whenever they might appear.

Principled. ISFPs will not sacrifice their principles for anything, and they have little tolerance for cheaters, liars or hypocrites. Because they are so respectful and find conflict distasteful, ISFPs will not confront people who disappoint them, but they will disassociate themselves from those individuals as soon as they possibly can. 

Individual. Some people spend their whole lives conforming to established standards and traditions. But ISFPs prefer to dance to the beat of their own drummers, relying on their own instincts to reveal what is right, good and true. ISFPs don’t do this as a way to gain attention, or stand out from the crowd. They simply believe that human nature is complex and varied and that everyone’s path should be unique. ","Too sensitive. Kind and considerate ISFPs are so determined to keep the peace that they frequently suppress their unpleasant emotions or ignore their own needs. Putting people first is great, but ISFPs too often forget to include themselves among that privileged group. Unfortunately, ISFPs are very sensitive and can have their feelings hurt at the drop of a hat, so their habit of deferring to the interests of others to avoid conflict tends to put them in uncomfortable positions time after time.

Indecisive and unpredictable. ISFPs are innovative, flexible and adaptable. But there is a fine line between flexibility and indecisiveness, and sometimes ISFPs are so open-minded that they are unable to make firm and final decisions. Too often, ISFPs sway back and forth like willows in the wind, changing their minds repeatedly in response to every persuasive argument they hear.

Easily bored. ISFPs are doers who learn through direct experience and imitation. If the instruction they receive seems too abstract or theoretical, ISFPs view it with suspicion, believing this style of teaching to be boring or irrelevant. But this preference can adversely affect their performance as students. Effective learning requires focus and commitment, and ISFPs at times are not as dedicated as they should be. This can limit their ability to absorb new and useful knowledge. 

Lack of future planning. ISFPs don’t always perceive the full consequences of their actions, or understand how the present inevitably shapes the future. Those who refuse to look beyond the immediate horizon may be unprepared for unpleasant happenings or overwhelmed by new duties and responsibilities—such as those that accompany the arrival of a child, for example. As a result, they may struggle with financial affairs, be ambushed by emergencies or fail to notice the way unresolved conflicts can poison relationships over the long term. ","Choose honesty over harmony. ISFPs do what they can to preserve harmony and promote the peace. But in order to avoid having their needs overlooked, ISFPs need to express themselves openly and honestly, even if what they have to say may be difficult for others to hear. This can cause strife in the short run, but in the long run it will help clear up misunderstandings and erase hurt feelings. 

Develop a wider concept of what it means to be bold and adventurous. ISFPs tend to underestimate their own skills and intelligence. As a result, they frequently choose not to express themselves or volunteer their services unless they are absolutely certain they will receive a positive reception. But when they surrender to these sorts of insecurities, ISFPs are actually passing up opportunities for adventure, which they normally crave. There’s satisfaction to be gained from breaking free of these chains. The results may be unpredictable, but the uncertainty is what provides the challenge. 

As Michael Jackson used to say, start with the man in the mirror. ISFPs have wonderful personal qualities. Their unselfishness and charitable attitude rank near the top of the list of their most attractive attributes. But ISFPs are so open-minded, respectful, considerate and polite that they tend to defer to others in virtually every circumstance. Too often, ISFPs treat others better than they treat themselves, acting as if their needs are somehow trivial or less important. So every now and then, ISFPs should make sure to include their own names on the list of the deserving—preferably somewhere near the top. Charity shouldn’t end at home, but there is no reason why it can’t begin there. 

Network with dreamers, visionaries and futurists. ISFPs are a bit skeptical of those whose imaginations seem bigger than their accomplishments. In some cases this is justified, but in general ISFPs could benefit by seeking social contact with people who possess the long-term vision they sometimes lack. Reading autobiographies or downloading video interviews with such folks will also help ISFPs gain more insight into the thinking patterns and philosophies of successful entrepreneurs and inventors. 

Actually make some plans for the future. It is possible for ISFPs to look ahead without abandoning their spontaneity and freedom. “What would I like to be doing five years from now?” “What does the phrase ‘personal growth’ mean to me?” “What would I like my life to look like when I turn 50?” These are the types of general, open-ended questions that can help ISFPs focus their creative energies without restricting their ability to make unique, spur-of-the-moment choices. ","THE COMPOSER
","ISFPs want to feel personally engaged with their work, and seek careers which allow them to express themselves or participate in a cause they believe in. ISFPs typically enjoy hands-on activities, and often gain satisfaction when they can create a tangible result from their efforts. An ideal job for an ISFP allows them to clearly observe the fruits of their labor, in a context that feels significant and consistent with their values.

ISFPs like a courteous, cooperative work environment where they can work quietly, with support when they need it. Because ISFPs are so tuned to their physical surroundings, it's often important to them that their work environment is aesthetically pleasing.

ISFPs generally prefer to keep a low profile and do not usually like to be in positions that require them to speak publicly or lead large groups. Although they often prefer to work independently, when they do work with others, ISFPs want their colleagues to be flexible, supportive, and loyal to the team.","ISTP

INTP,"INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.

INTPs are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time in their own heads: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding of how things work. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe.","INTPs present a cool exterior but are privately passionate about reason, analysis, and innovation. They seek to create complex systems of understanding to unify the principles they've observed in their environments. Their minds are complicated and active, and they will go to great mental lengths trying to devise ingenious solutions to interesting problems.

The INTP is typically non-traditional, and more likely to reason out their own individual way of doing things than to follow the crowd. The INTP is suspicious of assumptions and conventions, and eager to break apart ideas that others take for granted. INTPs are merciless when analyzing concepts and beliefs, and hold little sacred. They are often baffled by other people who remain loyal to ideology that doesn't make logical sense.","Analytically brilliance. Beneath the quiet surface sits an intellectual prowess which INTPs bring to any environment in which they find themselves. They are fast thinkers and highly logical. Others may not know it since much happens inside the INTP’s own own head, yet this type excels in analyzing connections between seemingly random pieces of information and finding flawless explanations to problems that disorient most other personality types.

Objective. INTPs are respected for their relentless pursuit of truth, objectivity and understanding. They make this the goal of their lives and channel their energy into rooting out errors and eliminating inconsistencies. They do this not only for their own personal enjoyment but because they see it as their main contribution to the world in whatever field they may find themselves. 

Imaginative. INTPs think deeply about theory, how to understand and explain difficult concepts, and how systems and products function and might be improved. They naturally see things others don’t because they have imaginations that are actively focused and fixated on future potential and possibility. 

Enthusiastic. To others, the INTP may come across as private and withdrawn but when a topic piques their interest, INTPs can be very enthusiastic⁠—excited even⁠—about discussing it. This excitement makes them fun to be around. In the right company, INTPs are keen to express their imaginative sense of humor, and enjoy being playful with people who they can trust.","Uncertainty. Despite their intellectual prowess, INTPs often live in fear of failure, anxious that they will overlook some critical aspect of their theory, idea or invention. This causes them to be self-conscious and to waste time and energy second-guessing themselves. 

Absent-mindedness. INTPs aren’t labeled “absentminded professors” for no reason. At their worst, they tend to be scattered and disorganized. Intellectual and high-minded, they get caught up in their own brains and fail to deal with the low-level tedium of the here and now such as bills or deadlines. They may fail to conform to even the basic expectations of daily life in society. 

Condescension. A significant weakness of the INTP is the tendency to be condescending and critical, either of their opponents or those who simply don’t catch on as quickly as they do. Their constant pursuit of truth and objectivity, though admirable, can also provoke brutality and impatience as they drive home their own perspective. This can be especially toxic in relationships in which logic simply does not always reign supreme. 

Insensitivity. INTPs can get into trouble because of their tendency to prioritize the activity taking place in their minds over the needs of others. They comfortably inhabit the realm of their imaginations and this can bring certain problems, not least that INTPs get so caught up in their own theories and abstractions that they forget any kind of emotional consideration. Their focus on ideas and logic, and neglect of personal considerations, can easily offend.","Develop emotional intelligence.Though INTPs can make very good friends and partners, they are not overly warm or attentive to the feelings and emotional cues of others. While emotional receptiveness and responsiveness will not come naturally to people of this type, focusing on key behaviors that help other people to feel heard and cared for will expand the INTP's ability to relate and connect.

Harness the power of relationships. Though they are naturally solitary, INTPs are not at their best when they neglect key relationships. INTPs can easily become isolated, especially if they are working on a difficult problem. While they may be indifferent to how many friends or personal relationships they have, INTPs who can learn to purposely cultivate their social and professional connections will be more successful—and happier in the end.

Bring others in. INTPs can easily find themselves rutted or caught in their own blind spots and, given the amount of time they spend in solitude, they may not regularly enjoy the input of others that can help to put them back on course. By bringing other people into their inner worlds, INTPs not only serve their relationships, they also get important feedback that can help them to clarify their high-level ideas and make them understandable and useful to a wider audience. 

Think practically. This may be a challenge because INTPs are not characteristically utilitarian or particularly pragmatic. This doesn’t mean they don’t value efficiency, but that they believe in the value of thinking and experimenting for its own sake, even if there is no practical value or outcome attached to it. While we need people who are committed to taking on dream projects and experiments simply because they’re good things to do, employers may be less sympathetic. INTPs should step back and consider their projects from a practical stance. Will this idea actually work? Does it matter? Is this a product people would actually use? Does it have practical value?

Become more charitable. INTPs will always be relentless about what is right, true and logical, but can become more charitable with time and effort. This will also involve working to understand and take into account the emotional concerns of others and seeking to develop empathy and compassion. INTPs can start by trying to look at and understand their own emotions.","THE ARCHITECT
","At work, the INTP is motivated to solve complex problems in an original, innovative way. Architects want to analyze systems and ideas thoroughly to create deep understanding, and enjoy designing creative solutions to highly abstract problems.

INTPs rarely have much interest in organizational traditions, preferring to forge their own path to innovation. They hate being limited by bureaucracy and rules, and are often more in tune with the theoretical soundness of their ideas than they are with the practical applications. They typically prefer to focus on creating the idea, and to leave the tedious details of implementation to someone else.

INTPs work best independently or with a small team of colleagues that they perceive as smart, competent, and logical. They quickly tire of colleagues who are aggressive or overbearing, and can be dismissive of people who aren't as clever as themselves.

An ideal organization for an INTP is flexible and non-traditional, and values ingenuity over conformity. An ideal job for an INTP allows them to address complex theoretical or technical problems with creative, novel solutions.","INTP

ISFJ,"ISFJs are industrious caretakers, loyal to traditions and organizations. They are practical, compassionate, and caring, and are motivated to provide for others and protect them from the perils of life.

ISFJs are conventional and grounded, and enjoy contributing to established structures of society. They are steady and committed workers with a deep sense of responsibility to others. They focus on fulfilling their duties, particularly when they are taking care of the needs of other people. They want others to know that they are reliable and can be trusted to do what is expected of them. They are conscientious and methodical, and persist until the job is done.","ISFJs are driven by their personal values, and are conscientious in their behavior. They typically want to work hard, get along with others, and make sure they do what is expected of them.

ISFJs value relationships highly and strive to cooperate and maintain harmony with others. They want stability and longevity in their relationships, and tend to maintain a deep devotion to family. They feel most connected with people they know they can rely upon over the long term.

ISFJs appreciate tradition and like knowing how things were done in the past. They are loyal to established methods and values, and want to observe the proper, accepted way of doing things. They place great importance on fitting in with established institutions and contributing what they can to maintain strong, stable social structures. In groups, they often take on the role of historian, ensuring that new members respect and value the established customs.","Practical. With a keen memory, an eagle’s eye for observation and an absolute determination to account for every detail, ISFJs are practical workers par excellence. When focused on a mission, ISFJs possess a Sherlock Holmes-like disposition to solving practical problems, built on an in-depth understanding of concrete facts. 

Hardworking. Intense and serious when a task needs to be completed, ISFJs are super-competent go getters who bring a hard-nosed approach to their work that can sometimes seem excessive to others. But it’s important to remember that ISFJs care deeply about people. When an ISFJ puts her game face on it is a sign that she believes what she is doing will improve people’s lives and is worth taking seriously. 

Supportive. ISFJs are the consummate helpers; happy to share their time and energy with anyone who needs it and taking an empathetic approach to problems and goals. As parents, partners, friends, students, workers, entrepreneurs, neighbors, community members, public servants and citizens, ISFJs always strive for excellence, and it is the inclusivity and comprehensiveness of their vision that forms their identity and gives them their unique ability to brighten every corner of the worlds they inhabit. 

True to their word. By now we are all familiar with the values that ISFJ hold dear: honor, integrity, responsibility, loyalty and commitment. This is all well and good, but to ISFJs it is far more important to walk the walk than talk the talk, and this is where ISFJs shine like the brightest stars. In business and personal relations, ISFJs are straight shooters who say what they mean and mean what they say. Their word is as good as gold. ","Resistant to change. ISFJs regard custom and tradition with the utmost respect and can become anxious with a world they see changing too fast and people who refuse to follow established standards. ISFJs in full ""tut-tut/tsk-tsk"" mode may convince themselves that moral decay and a loss of respect for personal responsibility are destroying our society from the inside out, and they can become so immersed in pessimism that they will start seeing signs of degeneration and devolution everywhere they look. Diversity of thought and opinion are truly the spices of life, but ISFJs can become so enamored with orthodoxy that they forget this essential fact of existence. 

Too altruistic. Loyalty is an admirable character trait to be sure; but it is a two-way street, and if the people we choose to trust prove to be dishonest or unreliable we must be prepared to walk away. Yet ISFJs struggle with letting go, and have a tendency to stay in it to the bitter end, convinced that this is the only honorable thing to do.

Take things personally. ISFJs are very private people, bordering on the shy, and this does not always mesh well with more open, unpredictable personality types. The social complexity of the environments they inhabit can overwhelm ISFJs and leave them feeling like square pegs in a universe of round holes. They have trouble dealing with conflict and a tendency to take even minor criticism personally. Combined with their stubborn streak, this can leave ISFJs feeling vulnerable and put upon, and they may resort to judgmental criticism themselves as a defense mechanism. 

Overload themselves. ISFJs are known for their terrific work ethic, but over time this positive trait can transmute into workaholism and leave an ISFJ so overloaded that she loses sight of everything else. Workaholic ISFJs can be driven to distraction by their perfectionist tendencies, and even on those rare occasions when they manage to tear themselves away from the office and return home for a while, they will continue to obsess over their latest project or assignment, leaving them too distracted and preoccupied to enjoy their free time. ","Seek out contact with alien life forms. ISFJs have a tendency to ensnare themselves in their own worldviews and spend far too much time living inside their own heads. As such, they desperately need social contact with people who have different mindsets and ideological inclinations; this type of constructive social interaction can help ISFJs become more comfortable with diversity and accepting of social change, and it can prevent them from developing that stern schoolmaster’s countenance that others find so reactionary and off- putting. 

Speak even when you haven’t been spoken to. In their dealings with other people ISFJs sometimes operate as if their life's purpose is to keep the peace and make everyone happy—everyone except themselves, that is. This habit of suppressing emotions and deferring to the needs of others may seem noble, but in reality it can trap the ISFJ in non-productive relationships that won’t make them happy. Speak up for yourself to reach your full potential as a human being. 

Step outside your comfort zone. This is good advice for everybody, but particularly for ISFJs who tend to get stuck in their routines to the point where they don’t have any time left over for fun and adventure. Take care to connect with your spontaneous, creative side, trying something new every now and then to ensure that your reverence for the tried-and-true does not calcify into rigidity. 

Lighten up! While the ISFJ’s serious and sober attitude may be well-intentioned, a little humor and irreverence from time to time never hurt anyone—you don’t want to be the person who sucks the life out of a room. When they are on the job in particular, ISFJs should realize that fun, laughter and the occasional unplanned coffee break can help relieve stress and build camaraderie, which will only help to boost workplace efficiency in the long run. 

Don’t worry, be happy. Caution in the face of the unknown is the ISFJ’s standard operating procedure, and it can be paralyzing—stopping personal growth in its tracks. It makes sense to worry in some instances but incessant worry is like a Death Star to happiness. Let go of the perfectionism every now and then and live a little. It’s only when you relax your strict standards that true happiness will come.  ",THE PROTECTOR,"At work, the ISFJ is motivated by the desire to help others in a practical, organized way. ISFJs are driven by their core of personal values, which often include upholding tradition, taking care of others, and working hard.

ISFJs enjoy work that requires careful attention to detail and adherence to established procedures, and like to be efficient and structured in their completion of tasks. They prefer an explicit authority structure and clear expectations.

ISFJs usually prefer to work behind the scenes, and like to receive recognition in a low-key way without being required to present their work publicly. They want to feel that they have fulfilled their duties, but do not want to be thrust into the spotlight.

An ideal job for an ISFJ involves well-defined work tasks that achieve a concrete or observable result, and does not require a lot of multi-tasking. An ideal work environment for an ISFJ is orderly, provides plenty of privacy, and includes colleagues who share the ISFJ’s values.","ISTJ

ENFJ,"ENFJs are idealist organizers, driven to implement their vision of what is best for humanity. They often act as catalysts for human growth because of their ability to see potential in other people and their charisma in persuading others to their ideas. They are focused on values and vision, and are passionate about the possibilities for people.

ENFJs are typically energetic and driven, and often have a lot on their plates. They are tuned into the needs of others and acutely aware of human suffering; however, they also tend to be optimistic and forward-thinking, intuitively seeing opportunity for improvement. The ENFJ is ambitious, but their ambition is not self-serving: rather, they feel personally responsible for making the world a better place.","ENFJs are driven by a deep sense of altruism and empathy for other people. They have an intuitive sense of the emotions of others, and often act as an emotional barometer for the people around them. However, their compassion not reserved for the people close to them: they are often humanitarian in nature, and may feel genuine concern for the ills of the entire human race. They tend to personally experience the feelings of others, and feel compelled to act when they see people suffering.

ENFJs want close, supportive connections with others, and believe that cooperation is the best way to get things done. They like to be liked and are very sensitive to feedback, both positive and negative. They expect the best not just from themselves, but from others as well, and may find themselves disappointed when others are not as genuine in their intentions as the ENFJ. ENFJs work hard to maintain strong relationships, and strive to be valuable members of their families, groups, and communities.","Peacekeeping. ENFJs not only work to promote harmony and morale while deflecting potential conflicts, they are also deft in persuading and motivating others to get moving in the same direction. They see positive relationships as the sure path to fulfillment and are highly cooperative, promoting cohesion and even friendship within the workplace and beyond. 

Communication. One of the many keys to an ENFJ’s success is the ability to communicate proficiently across diverse media. They have a talent for making words out of ideas whether it is in the classroom or in a love letter. ENFJs love writing, talking and telling stories, and their audiences are often equally as enthusiastic to receive what they have to say. As comfortable in large crowds as small groups, they like to be the center of attention and thrive on the energy of good conversation, especially with people who are as passionate as they are. 

Persuasiveness. ENFJs are known for their powers of persuasion and are generally effective in getting people to do what they want them to do. But ENFJs are charitable; the motive is not often manipulation or personal gain, they simply want people to do more or better because it will benefit them or help them realize some potential. These personalities are likeable and trustworthy and, as a result, others are generally compelled to listen to and follow them. 

Leadership. ENFJs have a solid social circle and are likely to be the ones planning events and finding opportunities to get people together. Their leadership skills ensure that others quickly jump on board and are excited about it. Teaching and mentoring come as easily to them as breathing and talking, making ENFJs particularly skilled in endeavors that allow them to lead, train or educate. Their idealism helps them to very clearly and accurately see the potential in other people and entities, and their Judging element helps them to map out the path to get there.","Leap before looking. Passionate and headstrong, ENFJs tend to dive in head first without fully examining or investigating the endeavor in front of them, or fully considering what it will entail. Their Intuitive nature gets the best of them and they are quite sure they have it all figured out; they may not concern themselves with the necessary and important details. 

Overcommitment. Though they thrive on being a little overwhelmed, ENFJs can easily become over-committed because they are genuinely excited about life and all of the opportunities they see before them—they want to say “yes” as much as they can and they want to do it all. As a result, they may later have to pull out of commitments they might have examined more carefully before jumping in, and often end up starting and stopping many things without finishing. 

Struggle to make tough decisions. When making decisions, ENFJs can struggle with information that seems to lack a human element. Hard logic, impersonal reasoning and data-based conclusions can be difficult and even undesirable. While ENFJs may be viewed as compassionate, they may also be seen as unfair since they are likely to prioritize the needs of the individual above the whole, and to look more readily to the exceptions than the rules. 

Too selfless. Because ENFJs prioritize people and the needs of others, they may not be properly in touch with their own needs and can struggle, at times, to express them if they fear that doing so may create conflict or disunity. If they have not developed a strong sense of self they may fail to be authentic in their relationships. As ENFJs already tend toward loneliness, the sense that no one truly knows them can foment the sense of being alone and misunderstood. ","Focus on the details. Though the ENFJ reads best between the lines, there are times when the nit-picky details really do matter and, in the end, the boring, impersonal contracts just need to be read. This will be a forced response, but a necessary one. In committing to various projects, endeavors or events, the ENFJ will benefit from a simple “let me think about it” and then actually taking the time to consider the details, objectives and time commitment before responding. 

Stick to it. ENFJs love starting projects and new endeavors, but sometimes bite off more than they can chew. Rather than looking at the project as a whole and becoming overwhelmed, breaking the work into small pieces and viewing each chunk as a distinct goal can help the ENFJ maintain enthusiasm and drive. 

Get comfortable with conflict. Disunity, divisiveness and conflict are not the end of the world and not something always to be avoided. ENFJs do crave amicable rather than adversarial relationships, but growth often happens in the space of tension. When the ENFJ allows himself to intentionally confront and deal with conflict, good things—even deepened relationships—may result.  

Live in the now. ENFJs are, by nature, future-oriented and while this helps them to visualize potential, it can keep them from dealing with life in the here and now—the possibilities are so much more exciting than the present reality! While ENFJs will continue to look to the best the future has to offer, they need to put their scheduling and planning skills into practice to get going on the tasks of today so that they may achieve their future goals. 

Mind their bottom line. While ENFJs do derive personal satisfaction from being helpful to others, they must be serious about their own talents and the income that should come as a result. It is possible to help people, make a contribution to the world and make a living wage. The ENFJ may also need to work on becoming more task oriented and concerned with productivity. It is easy to get caught up in the relational aspects of a project or job and fail to meet the objectives and expectations. The ENFJ will have to work to keep interpersonal relations and productivity in balance. ",THE TEACHER,"At work, the ENFJ is motivated to organize others to implement positive change. ENFJs are enthusiastic problem-solvers, especially when they can put their strong intuition about people to good use.

ENFJs strive for cooperation and work best in a harmonious environment where they can support other people and encourage their growth. They often take on a mentor role, seeing their primary aim as helping other people become better at what they do.

ENFJs are often attracted to leadership roles; they naturally organize people to take advantage of their unique talents. They often have a strong vision in their work, and enjoy being able to use their creativity to develop innovative initiatives with a humanitarian focus. ENFJs appreciate teamwork, and they want to have the organizational resources to put their ideas into action.

The ideal work environment for an ENFJ is forward-thinking and people-centered, with a clear humanitarian mission and an emphasis on constructive action. The ideal job for an ENFJ allows them to develop and implement ideas that improve the circumstances and well-being of other people.","INFJ

ENTP,"ENTPs are inspired innovators, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually challenging problems. They are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. Open-minded and unconventional, Visionaries want to analyze, understand, and influence other people.

ENTPs enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. They use their quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While the ENTP enjoys challenging others, in the end they are usually happy to live and let live. They are rarely judgmental, but they may have little patience for people who can't keep up.","ENTPs are energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve. They are confident in their ability to think creatively, and may assume that others are too tied to tradition to see a new way. The Visionary relies on their ingenuity to deal with the world around them, and rarely finds preparation necessary. They will often jump into a new situation and trust themselves to adapt as they go.

ENTPs are masters of re-inventing the wheel and often refuse to do a task the same way twice. They question norms and often ignore them altogether. Established procedures are uninspiring to the Visionary, who would much rather try a new method (or two) than go along with the standard.","Fearlessness. One of the ENTP’s greatest strengths and keys to success is his or her boldness in the face of challenge. These are people who are not afraid to try and fail and try again, perhaps thousands of times; they don’t conceive of it as failure, merely another step along the path to success. As they invent and innovate, they are undeterred by doubts, they are barely ruffled when outcomes don’t go as planned and they see all “problems” as opportunities to be embraced and pursued. 

Innovation. In all things—products, procedures and systems—ENTPs know there is always a better way and with the right kind of thinking, they will get there. As a result, they may suffer a lot of seeming failures in their lives, but will enjoy many successes as well. They can be marvelously rich and lose their entire life savings—perhaps a few times within the course of their lives. They live out loud and take risks.

Adaptability. ENTPs are generally go-with-the-flow people. This isn’t to say that they are particularly agreeable individuals, but that they are able to adapt to their circumstances and the problems that arise in life and work. ENTPs can improvise on the fly and come up with creative solutions rapidly. They deal well with fast-paced and frequent change and enjoy the corresponding challenges.

Confidence. Generally speaking, criticism and ostracism have very little effect on ENTPs. They are confident in their skills and talents and believe in the power of their ideas. Opposition on the way to success is to be expected and they don’t take it personally; they’d rather prove their detractors wrong.","Flightiness. That which is a strength can easily become a weakness and this is seen in the case of ENTPs and their idea-generating nature. While this can be the ENTP’s greatest strength, it can also mean that the ENTP may be flighty and flaky, jumping from one idea to the next and struggling to follow through. Their fear of missing out can make it hard to commit to one idea or one path; they want to keep exploring and evaluating.

Impracticality. ENTPs have a chaotic air about them that can range from amusing to aggravating, especially to coworkers and spouses. In their tendency to get caught up in their ideas they often lose sight of the immediate tasks around them such as house work, yard work and other responsibilities of daily living, such as paying bills. An ENTP may be stunningly brilliant but also poor, disorganized and seemingly untethered.

Breaking norms. Nonconformity, while it can be a positive trait, often gets the ENTP into trouble. Their entire approach to life is founded upon charting their own course, pushing the boundaries and doing things their way. While this leads to great creativity and advances in their fields, in can also put them at odds with authority figures and superiors, which can, in turn, hinder their progress and impede their success. “Incorrigible” and “stubborn” are two words that wouldn’t be out of place in describing a typical ENTP.

Procrastination. ENTPs are also known for their tendencies toward procrastination and poor time management. To some degree, this is a product of their Perceiving component in which they prefer to continue taking in information rather than making a decision and getting down to business. The issue is not necessarily laziness as much as it is a disinclination to stop the intake of ideas and information in order to move forward with one idea or one decision. They have a hard time prioritizing tasks and will struggle to keep new information and ideas from getting in the way of the work at hand.","Do a little more research. ENTPs are quick to dive into new projects and ideas headfirst. While this enthusiastic “all in” quality can be a strength, it can also be detrimental when people of this type fail to do the due diligence or to pay adequate attention to the details. The ENTP can help avoid wasted time and money by stepping back and investigating first. 

Look at the “small picture.” As big-picture people and conceptual thinkers, people of this type are focused on the broad themes and patterns and the big, important projects, often letting the details fall by the wayside. However details—while nothing more than a bother to the ENTP—are often essential. ENTPs will do well to realize that details often end up eating more time in the long run if neglected or overlooked.

Learn to adapt to rules and structures. Rules aren’t actually made to be broken, contrary to the ENTP’s belief, and the people who follow them aren’t to be disdained as thoughtless or unintelligent. These boundaries provide order. If everyone disregarded them we’d be living in very different circumstances. ENTPs will get along better at work and in society if they can try to have a little respect for authority and follow the rules.

Stick to it. ENTPs generate so many different ideas and interesting options that they simply want to explore them all. While this can be an asset, it also can deter them from simply getting on with the work at hand. At some point, in order to be most productive, the ENTP needs to make a decision on a course of action, plot the steps to the finish and then just get going.

Differentiate between the possible and the probable. ENTPs often don’t properly distinguish between these two categories and thus find themselves spending a wealth of resources pursuing something that, though possible, is not at all probable. People of this type will do well to factor in the feasibility of various ideas when considering their many options. ","THE VISIONARY
","At work, the ENTP is concerned with applying innovative solutions to challenging problems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of systems. ENTPs often take an entrepreneurial approach to their work and they prefer to approach tasks in a casual and unstructured way, with few limitations on their ingenuity.

ENTPs prize competency and often want to be the expert. They enjoy work that demands continual improvement in their knowledge and skills. They value power, and want a career that allows them contact with powerful people and the opportunity to increase their own influence.

ENTPs are idea people, and chafe at routine. They get bored very quickly when required to repeat a task or attend to details. They do best when their work is highly conceptual, and allows them to solve problems creatively without having to think through the details.

The ideal work environment for an ENTP is intellectually challenging without being rigid, with creative and intelligent coworkers. The ideal job for an ENTP allows them to put their creativity to work developing innovative ideas, while allowing them to delegate responsiblity for the tedious details of implementation to others.","INTP

ESFP,"ESFPs are vivacious entertainers who charm and engage those around them. They are spontaneous, energetic, and fun-loving, and take pleasure in the things around them: food, clothes, nature, animals, and especially people.

ESFPs are typically warm and talkative and have a contagious enthusiasm for life. They like to be in the middle of the action and the center of attention. They have a playful, open sense of humor, and like to draw out other people and help them have a good time.","ESFPs live in the moment, enjoying what life has to offer. They are especially tuned into their senses and take pleasure in the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around them. ESFPs like to keep busy, filling their lives with hobbies, sports, activities, and friends. Because they'd rather live spontaneously than plan ahead, they can become overextended when there are too many exciting things to do. An ESFP hates nothing more than missing out on the fun.

Although they are characteristically fun-loving, ESFPs are also typically practical and down-to-earth. They are grounded in reality and are usually keenly aware of the facts and details in their environment, especially as they pertain to people. They are observant of others and their needs, and responsive in offering assistance. ESFPs enjoy helping other people, especially in practical, tangible ways.","Showmanship. ESFPs have lively personalities which they use to liven up every room they occupy. Bringing smiles and enjoyment to others gives the ESFP greater satisfaction than anything else in the world. Being cheerful, entertaining and humorous comes naturally to ESFPs, and the people who know them best realize their interest in the happiness of others is sincere and motivated by empathetic and compassionate instincts.

Supportive. ESFPs do like to be the center of attention, but they also prize the spirit of cooperation and never try to hog the spotlight when asked to work on group projects. It is really the social give-and-take that ESFPs enjoy the most, and if they act as facilitators in cooperative situations it is only because their outgoing natures predispose them to take the lead. As teammates or partners, ESFPs will always listen to what everyone has to say, will never try to force their ideas on anyone. 

Positivity. ESFPs are the quintessential positive thinkers, firmly believing the bright side is the only one worth looking at. ESFPs see every minute of wasted time as a lost opportunity, and they can’t stand to throw away chances for fun, conversation, excitement or unique experience. Furthermore, they do a fantastic job of passing on their enthusiasm and hopefulness to their companions, and that is why some of the most admired self-help gurus and motivational speakers come from the ESFP ranks. 

Bold and practical. Because they refuse to live in the past or the future, or get distracted by dreams or fantasies about the way the world should be, ESFPs are high-quality practical workers who never sacrifice their determination to accomplish remarkable things in the present moment. They want desperately to help others, but they also want to see results from their efforts immediately and aren’t willing to be patient. ESFPs will put the pedal to the metal in a heartbeat if they see opportunities to make a constructive impact in the lives of the people they care about most. ","Avoid conflict. The one problem with “glass half full” types is that they will sometimes deny unpleasant truths or avoid uncomfortable situations if they feel it might cast a dark cloud. ESFPs hate buzzkills, and this makes them a bit squeamish about conflict, persistent social problems and a variety of other unfortunate circumstances that can’t be wished away or overcome with a cheerful attitude.  

Sensitive. It is ironic given their tendency to showmanship and outspokenness, but ESFPs are extremely sensitive and can be deeply hurt when others criticize their ideas, personalities or conduct. They have a tough time seeing such criticism as constructive, and they usually react with anger and resentment when they feel someone is questioning or attacking them. 

Easily bored. With a need for constant excitement, ESFPs find it hard to maintain their focus on the topic at hand; often demonstrating the sort of attention span normally seen only in kindergarten classrooms. This can make them appear flighty and unfocused. Life is not a non-stop party, and ESFPs do need to knuckle down if they are to turn their high energy into an accomplished goal. 

Poor long-term focus. When given the choice between theory and proven practice, ESFP will choose the latter every time. They distrust abstract concepts, future hypotheses and big picture projections and this makes them poor long-term planners. ESFPs aren’t as good at recognizing alternatives as they should be, and this can blind them to exciting possibilities for growth, evolution and constructive change. ","Make lists and write down goals. Too often, the spontaneity and impulsivity of ESFPs leads them astray. To avoid spur-of-the-moment decision making, ESFPs should try to set goals and organize their activities ahead of time, possibly with the assistance of written lists and schedules. This would give them a clear life plan to refer back to, keeping them on the straight and narrow when faced with temptation. 

Don’t ignore the long-term consequences. By focusing on practical matters so intently, ESFPs sometimes waste chances to improve their lives and establish long-term goals. We all need to broaden our horizons and step back so we can see things from a greater perspective. ESFPs would benefit from undertaking a meaningful dialogue with the dreamers, creators and visionaries in their lives. The more relationships ESFPs can form with big picture thinkers the better off they will be. 

Assume it’s all constructive criticism. ESFPs are sensitive to criticism of all types. They take it personally and often react with resentment and defensiveness. This is not an easy personality trait to subdue but, with practice, ESFPs can reprogram their thinking patterns, becoming less reactive and more open minded over time. As a starting point, ESFPs should attempt to convince themselves that all the criticism they receive is meant to be constructive—which it might very well be. If they can reach this point, their personal growth is all but ensured. 

Investigate alternative learning strategies. ESFPs often have a hard time functioning in formal academic environments, where it is impossible to escape from the abstract and the theoretical. They prefer practical, hands-on learning that will help them develop specific skills that can be applied in real-world situations.  Fortunately, there are alternative learning environments that can provide an ESFP-friendly learning experience—internships, apprenticeships, trade schools or technical colleges, individualized study programs at online universities. ESFPs could benefit tremendously if they ventured away from the traditional educational model and forged their own path. 

Shine a flashlight into the darkest corners. ESFPs are notorious for avoiding unpleasant topics or situations. But running from trouble actually empowers it, allowing it to ruin relationships if tensions are left unaddressed. Instead of avoiding things that make them uncomfortable, ESFPs would be better off to confront them, before they have the chance to do any real damage. A positive attitude should not be used as an excuse for denial, which is always a bad idea no matter the circumstances. ","THE PERFORMER
","At work, the ESFP wants to be hands-on and in the middle of the action. ESFPs prefer an active, social work environment where they are free to be spontaneous and have fun, with co-workers who are friendly, laid-back, and enthusiastic.

ESFPs are pragmatic, realistic, and tuned into the needs of others. They often choose a job that allows them to be of service to people, and where they can see real, tangible results for their efforts. They are talented at solving practical, people-centered problems, and can put this skill to good use in assisting others.

ESFPs are keenly tuned into their senses and often have an artistic streak. They may choose careers that engage their sensual nature through food, textiles, art, or music. ESFPs often want a career that allows them to move around, and generally prefer a work environment that is aesthetically pleasing.

ESFPs are stressed by strict rules or excessive bureaucracy at work, and want the flexibility to address situations as they arise. They generally focus on the demands of the present moment, and do not usually like to work on long-term projects, preferring work that has immediate and tangible results.","ISFP

ENFP,"ENFPs are people-centered creators with a focus on possibilities and a contagious enthusiasm for new ideas, people and activities. Energetic, warm, and passionate, ENFPs love to help other people explore their creative potential.

ENFPs are typically agile and expressive communicators, using their wit, humor, and mastery of language to create engaging stories. Imaginative and original, ENFPs often have a strong artistic side. They are drawn to art because of its ability to express inventive ideas and create a deeper understanding of human experience.","ENFPs tend to be curious about others and preoccupied with discovering the deeper meaning in people and ideas. They want authentic experience and often seek emotional intensity. ENFPs are easily bored by details and repetition and seek out situations that offer an escape from the mundane. Novelty is attractive to ENFPs, who often have a wide range of interests and friends from many backgrounds.

ENFPs prize individuality and often consider the pursuit of happiness to be the highest priority in life, both for themselves and for others. They place great importance on personal freedom and self-expression, and want to be able to go wherever inspiration leads.","Excellent communicators. ENFPs have outstanding communication skills and they know how to use them. They will engage anyone in conversation at the drop of a hat, and they know how to draw others out in a way that keeps the discussion flowing. Whether casually shooting the breeze or collaborating in the workplace, ENFPs provide the horsepower that keeps the engine of conversation humming along. 

Imaginative. ENFPs are imaginative problem solvers and reject the idea that traditional ways are always the best. In every situation they believe an original approach is possible—and desirable—and they refuse to become prisoners of habit or routine. They see roadblocks as opportunities, and they confront every challenge they face with fresh eyes and no preconceived notions. 

Natural leaders. ENFPs step forward to assume positions of leadership readily and instinctively. They are confident in their ability to handle demanding responsibilities many people find scary or intimidating. ENFP leaders are consensus builders who work hard to gain the trust of their associates, patiently listening to their ideas and reacting enthusiastically to their good suggestions. Their assertive, “can-do” attitude inspires others and motivates them to action.

Strong social conscience. Often active in social movements, ENFPs stand up for what they believe in without apology. Some people talk the compassion game but don’t follow through with meaningful action, but ENFPs believe it is vitally important to back up caring words with good deeds. Despite their friendly nature, an ENFP will go supernova with righteous anger when they are exposed to suffering and injustice. They can get quite loud and assertive, if that’s what it takes to get their opinions heard.","Hypersensitivity. ENFPs sometimes let their imaginations run wild and often perceive bad intentions that don’t really exist. Being hyper-alert and aware helps ENFPs improve their social comprehension, but reading between the lines only works when something is actually hidden there. If it isn’t, misunderstandings can occur and hurt feelings can damage good relationships.

Lack of focus and follow through. ENFPs are endlessly creative, capable of filling a thousand days with a thousand bold ideas. But they don’t always follow through on their inspirations, and if others are not brought on board to handle the details, their best ideas may never be put into practice. ENFPs rely on their initial excitement and passion too much and don’t always show the discipline necessary to translate their ideas into real-world production. They have a tendency to start new projects before the last ones are finished, and failing to see things through is where ENFPs sometimes come up short. 

Overthink things. ENFPs have a tendency to perceive slights, resentments or hostility where none actually exist, and their habit of overanalyzing other people’s behavior can lead to unnecessary anger and conflict. If ENFPs aren’t receiving as many compliments as they expect from their significant others, their insecurities can be activated and they may start to feel unappreciated and unloved. 

Overemotional and approval-seeking. While emotional expression is a core part of the ENFP's identity, they can come on too strong. The bubbly, energetic style of ENFPs doesn’t mesh well with every partner and introverts, in particular, can sometimes feel steamrolled in their presence. ENFPs are also approval-seekers, and in their desire to receive praise and acknowledgment they may try a little too hard to make a good impression, talking too much and listening too little in the process. ","Accept the fact that if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck ... ENFPs are intuitive and have a sharp eye for detail. They make a mistake, however, when they insist on looking for hidden motivations or covert agendas everywhere. In normal social encounters, ENFPs should make a real effort to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and take words and actions at face value. Assuming the worst can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, since people will eventually sense an ENFP’s mistrust and return it in kind. 

Take the foot off the accelerator. In social situations, that is. When ENFPs are tempted to turn on the charm just a bit more, or pick up the intensity in their presentation style, they would be wise to resist those urges. Smiling and nodding and listening are excellent communication tools. Interestingly, because they are so good with words, ENFPs actually need fewer of them to make their points or establish solid human connections in most instances. 

Don’t shirk the “dirty” work. ENFPs don’t always see projects through to the end, preferring to hop from one endeavor to another like a hungry hummingbird flitting through a juicy flower patch. So every once in a while, as a change of pace, ENFPs should make it a point to maintain tight control all the way to the finish. Detail work and project management do not always come naturally to ENFPs. But they have the insight and know-how to handle all the small stuff, if they just make the decision to put their noses to the grindstone and keep them there until the process is complete.

Look inside for validation. ENFPs enjoy compliments and try very hard to please, and this has a subtle, and not entirely positive, effect on their behavior. When ENFPs pay too much attention to the opinions of others, it can prevent them from following their own instincts and leave them open to manipulation. “If being true to myself gets me in hot water, then so be it”—that is what ENFPs should tell themselves when they start worrying too much about what other people think. 

Find good partners. Because they are a little lax with the details, ENFPs need assistants and co-workers who can handle the duties they tend to overlook. ENFPs enjoy working in teams so it should not be a big stretch to form relationships or partnerships with people whose skills complement their own. In their personal lives, ENFPs can also benefit by making connections with those who are good at the aspects of life they neglect. This could certainly be said about any of us, but ENFPs have a strong independent streak and may not reach out to others for help as often as they should.",THE CHAMPION,"At work, the ENFP is concerned with using their creativity to express themselves and benefit others. ENFPs want to explore the possibilities for themselves and other people, and approach their work with vision and inspiration. They enjoy taking on creative or people-centered problems that call for an imaginative, original solution.

ENFPs are often motivated by their beliefs in humanitarian causes and want work that is consistent with their values. They are particularly interested in helping other people develop as individuals. They tend to choose careers that allow them to pursue ideals of personal growth and artistic expression.

ENFPs dislike routine work and want a variety of tasks and challenges. They prefer to set their own schedule and chafe when saddled with excessive regulations or mundane details. They seek out fun, novel tasks that allow them to be imaginative and relate to other people in an unstructured, supportive way.

The ideal work environment for an ENFP is relaxed and friendly, with few restrictions on creativity. The ideal job for an ENFP allows them to follow their inspiration, satisfy their curiosity, and develop solutions that benefit people in innovative and original ways.","INFP

ESTP,"ESTPs are energetic thrillseekers who are at their best when putting out fires, whether literal or metaphorical. They bring a sense of dynamic energy to their interactions with others and the world around them. They assess situations quickly and move adeptly to respond to immediate problems with practical solutions.

Active and playful, ESTPs are often the life of the party and have a good sense of humor. They use their keen powers of observation to assess their audience and adapt quickly to keep interactions exciting. Although they typically appear very social, they are rarely sensitive; the ESTP prefers to keep things fast-paced and silly rather than emotional or serious.","ESTPs are often natural athletes; they easily navigate their physical environment and are typically highly coordinated. They like to use this physical aptitude in the pursuit of excitement and adventure, and they often enjoy putting their skills to the test in risky or even dangerous activities.

The ESTP's focus is action in the moment. They are engaged with their environments and solve practical problems quickly. ESTPs are excellent in emergencies, when they can apply their logical reasoning to situations where immediate action is necessary. Long-term goals are less interesting to the ESTP, who prefers to see tangible results in the moment.","Can-do attitude. No one will ever call an ESTP lazy or uncertain, and this very self-assured, can-do approach to life and work is certainly a strength. People of this type spend more time acting than thinking, and while this may seem potentially unwise and hasty, they actually process information very rapidly and have a knack for improvising as they go. This makes them excellent in emergency situations as they think on the fly and respond reflexively. 

Bold. ESTPs also abound in a mental toughness and sense of competition that make them relentless in pursuing what they are after. They respond well to their physical environment and know how to maneuver their world. They are efficient, clever, bold and driven. And as a result, they often get what they are after and aren’t afraid to take a few risks to get there. 

Personable and sociable. ESTPs are people-focused and get along well with just about anyone. They are observant and perceptive, and they read people well. This has the benefit of helping others to feel that they are cared about because the ESTP pays attention and responds appropriately. Though ESTPs may not always pick up on or prioritize emotional cues, they are quick to notice and respond to tangible needs.

Direct. ESTPs are efficient, matter of fact, direct and to the point. They don’t mince words or want to spend a lot of time hemming and hawing. Many people appreciate their honesty and even their bluntness; you always know where you stand with an ESTP. They aren’t afraid to call it like they see it. ","Judgmental. While ESTPs’ powers of perception and observation are often seen as strengths, it may also mean they are quick to prejudge situations and people, and to categorize them based upon initial perceptions. The downfall of this is that they potentially sacrifice many opportunities for profitable or enjoyable relationships or experiences simply on the basis of initial outward appearances. 

Impatient. Because ESTPs are quick thinkers and doers, they easily become impatient with those who process at a slower pace than they do, who lack their capacity for common sense or street smarts or who tend to be more sensitive or emotional. They feel the emotional concerns of others to be an unnecessary drain on their energy and may resent them. ESTPs will also be reluctant to afford weight to intuition or feelings-based arguments.

Unstructured. People of this type tend to live in a state of urgency and emergency because they do very little advance planning. Though they may be comfortable with this pattern of living, it breeds chaos for everyone around them and can impede their professional and personal relationships. The crux of the issue is that ESTPs are often unstructured and undisciplined, exercising poor time management skills and taking on far more than they can handle; often because they have a hard time saying no or they refuse to admit they can’t fit it all in. 

Commitment phobic. ESTPs hate to be bored and want life to always be new, stimulating and interesting. The reality, however, is that life is often not interesting or novel and relationships can get a little dull at certain points. They often lack the patience and the drive to stick it out through the low points.","Look inward. ESTPs will benefit from taking time for self-reflection and introspection, especially as they age. Throughout their lives they are prone to focus externally, always responding to their environments and the needs of the moment. The constant attention to things outside of themselves can distract them from healthy introspection, causing them to overlook important aspects of their own character and development and leave personal blind spots unaddressed. 

Consider the consequences. ESTPs are natural risk takers, prone to pursue adventure and risky behaviors. Naturally, this invites the potential for disastrous consequences. Though ESTPs are quite confident in their abilities and usually accurate in these personal assessments, they will benefit from greater time spent considering the potential outcomes of their actions and decisions. 

Think ahead. ESTPs live life so much in the present that they are often incapable of effectively planning for the future. Though they do enjoy flying by the seat of their pants, ESTPs will find they benefit from composing at least a loose plan or framework. It isn’t necessary to follow it exactly, but it can help ensure that they move in the direction of meeting their personal and professional goals. They may benefit from help with long-range future planning as well as developing time management skills. 

Follow through. Constant living and responding in the moment can impede follow through and follow up. People of this type must endeavor to balance the acute with the chronic, the emergency situation or deadline with regular life. ESTPs should try to look at the whole project or problem and its future impact, not just the urgent piece. For the ESTP it is easy, and even comfortable, to jump from urgency to urgency, putting out fires one by one. But jobs need to be finished and wrapped up before hopping to the next task. 

Check the rulebook. ESTPs naturally follow their own plans, systems and internal codes. This isn’t because they are intentionally insubordinate, but because they often don’t consider that there may be rules or established protocol that should be considered before plunging ahead. They will avoid unnecessary conflict and tension in the workplace if they can remember to get their plans approved before getting started. ",THE DYNAMO,"At work, the ESTP is motivated to solve logical problems in the moment. ESTPs have a solid grasp of the concrete realities of a situation and a good sense of the resources at their disposal. Because they understand the facts of the present, they are often able to quickly see a way out of difficult situations.

The ESTP relies on past experience to choose the best approach for the situation at hand. ESTPs are concrete and hands-on, and have a kinetic sense of how things work. Although ESTPs may have trouble envisioning abstract ideas, they are flexible in their approach: if something sounds logical, they are usually willing to give it a try.

ESTPs often choose careers that take advantage of their athleticism, their mechanical skills, or their ability to negotiate their physical surroundings. They tend to prefer objects to ideas and often like a tangible product. They may have trouble sitting still and often avoid being stuck behind a desk.

ESTPs like a job that is a bit unpredictable, and offers them some fun and adventure throughout the workday. They want a job which allows them plenty of flexibility to solve problems on the spot, without pressure to follow set procedures or plans.","ISTP

ESTJ,"ESTJs are hardworking traditionalists, eager to take charge in organizing projects and people. Orderly, rule-abiding, and conscientious, ESTJs like to get things done, and tend to go about projects in a systematic, methodical way.

ESTJs are the consummate organizers, and want to bring structure to their surroundings. They value predictability and prefer things to proceed in a logical order. When they see a lack of organization, the ESTJ often takes the initiative to establish processes and guidelines, so that everyone knows what's expected.","ESTJs are conventional, factual, and grounded in reality. For the ESTJ, the proof is in the past: what has worked and what has been done before. They value evidence over conjecture, and trust their personal experience. ESTJs look for rules to follow and standards to meet, and often take a leadership role in helping other people meet expectations as well. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and keeping others in line.

ESTJs often take on a project manager role at home as well as at work, and excel at setting goals, making decisions, and organizing resources to accomplish a task. The ESTJ wants to achieve efficient productivity and typically believes this is best accomplished when people and systems are well organized.","Organization and efficiency. ESTJs are planners and list makers—orderly and scheduled. Their brain naturally imposes structure on their lives and on their time. ESTJs enjoy creating order out of chaos and are always punctual. This contributes to the perception others have of them as reliable, dependable and steady. 

Dedication and commitment. No one could accuse the ESTJ of shirking, and it’s natural for this type to give 110 percent in all areas of life and exhibit boundless energy as they do. They’d sooner sacrifice their personal time or preferences than renege on a commitment or fail to submit their best work. Employers can count on ESTJs to uphold the vision of the organization at all times, to work at full speed and to encourage others to do the same. 

Integrity. ESTJs demonstrate consistent integrity in roles of leadership, believing the rules apply as much to them as their subordinates. And though they skillfully exercise authority, they also show great respect for their own superiors and don’t struggle to follow orders. They see that organizations and societies function best when there is a healthy sense of respect and duty. 

Stewardship. ESTJs are the gatekeepers of society. They are people who feel personally responsible for upholding the standard and formulating a very clear picture of what passes and what doesn’t. As such, ESTJs can always be counted on to uphold the laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that keep society structured and functioning smoothly. On the home front, ESTJs are committed to their families and desire to provide well for anyone they consider to be under their care. ","Judgmental. A black-and-white approach to life can be a significant pitfall for the ESTJ. While they are commendably committed to their beliefs, they often forget that all of the principles they espouse are neither universal nor objective, and the traditional, time-honored way isn’t the only way. ESTJs may fail to see that innovation can be beneficial and can be impatient with people who choose non-conventional lifestyles, coming across as judgmental or narrow-minded as a result. 

Uncomfortable with emotions. ESTJs often fail to value emotions or take feelings into account—their own and others’—and this can make them appear harsh, abrasive, utilitarian and uncaring. Their typically low EQ may lead them to misjudge the intentions of others and to be equally misunderstood. They often have little patience for people who think or act intuitively or who react emotionally, seeing these as liabilities rather than potential strengths. 

Workaholism. While the ESTJ work ethic is to be commended, people of this type can also err on the side of workaholism and perfectionism. Their Type A personality and intensity can be a little hard for others to take, as they are often quite unsympathetic to those who may not work as hard or as “perfectly” as they do. 

Stubborn and inflexible. ESTJs are committed to their own way or perspective as objectively right, and this can impede the process of personal growth. In fact, ESTJs are often so firmly planted in their original belief, as well as their own rightness, that they fail to acknowledge new or conflicting information that would lead to an altered and perhaps truer conclusion. Rigidity can keep them from being truly open minded and their practical approach to thinking and life in general may stifle their ability to think imaginatively or to exercise vision.","Withhold judgment. ESTJs may be quite sure they have the motive, intent, outcome and conclusion figured out before they’ve received even a fraction of the details, and fail to acknowledge that he or she may not have the whole story. They will do well to hold off a bit before delivering a snap judgment or assessment. Focus on asking more questions, waiting for more details and acknowledging that as certain as you are, there may be things you are not seeing. 

Live and let live. ESTJs often don’t realize that their way isn’t the only way and that other personalities have much to contribute and should not be dismissed. The ESTJ that can bend a little might find that flexibility and openness isn’t such a bad thing. There is really no need to be stubborn just for the sake of it. 

Be more self-critical. ESTJs have a tendency to think they are always right and that their moral compass is objective, absolute and universal. But their objectivity isn’t always objective as it appears—they have a standard that feels objective to them, often due to “how it’s always been done.” They would benefit from realizing that personal objectivity is, by definition, somewhat subjective, and spending some time examining the bases of their beliefs.

Get in touch with their feelings. ESTJ’s need to work on acknowledging their own feelings, and being a little more careful with the feelings of others. While it may seem that it’s “not personal,” it may be to a subordinate or a child. Harshness and rigidity can drive away good employees and estrange family members, so make a point to recognize the gifts and talents of others and to be intentional in showing appreciation for these talents. 

Take it easy. ESTJs need to work on stress relief and intentionally taking it easy. While they don’t want to be seen as lazy, it helps to remember that leisure and rest are not signs of sloth, but normal ways in which humans recharge. ESTJs benefit from taking vacations that really are vacations (not endless activity, planning and tourism) and to practice forced rest. Practices such as yoga, tai chi and meditation can help. ","THE SUPERVISOR
","At work, the ESTJ excels at organizing—people, projects, and operations. ESTJs like to be in control and often seek out management positions, preferring to be in a role where they can make decisions and enforce policies and procedures.

ESTJs quickly develop a reputation in the workplace as people who can be trusted to deliver, on time and as requested. They are unfailingly reliable and gain satisfaction from bringing a project to completion. Because of their eagerness to take on responsibility, they sometimes become overworked.

The ideal work environment for an ESTJ is highly structured, with a clear set of expectations and an organized authority structure. The ideal job for an ESTJ allows them to use their organizational skills within a set of standardized procedures to efficiently produce a tangible product.","ISTJ

ENTJ,"ENTJs are strategic leaders, motivated to organize change. They are quick to see inefficiency and conceptualize new solutions, and enjoy developing long-range plans to accomplish their vision. They excel at logical reasoning and are usually articulate and quick-witted.

ENTJs are analytical and objective, and like bringing order to the world around them. When there are flaws in a system, the ENTJ sees them, and enjoys the process of discovering and implementing a better way. ENTJs are assertive and enjoy taking charge; they see their role as that of leader and manager, organizing people and processes to achieve their goals.","ENTJs are often very motivated by success in their careers and enjoy hard work. They are ambitious and interested in gaining power and influence. To the ENTJ, decision-making is a vocation. They want to be in a position to make the call and put plans into motion.

ENTJs tend to be blunt and decisive. Driven to get things done, they can sometimes be critical or brusque in the pursuit of a goal. They are typically friendly and outgoing, although they may not pick up on emotional subleties in other people. They often love working with others toward a common goal, but may not find time to attend to their feelings. They are focused on results and want to be productive, competent, and influential.","Strong willed. One thing that is especially admirable about ENTJs is their near imperviousness to criticism. Once they have formed a position or made a decision, they don’t buckle under pressure. They are just that certain of the rightness of their beliefs and the deft logic that brought them there. To sway ENTJs, you must either outsmart them or prove them wrong. ENTJs don’t mind being criticized, don’t take things personally and are not afraid to hold the outside opinion. 

Efficient. ENTJs are known for their sheer productivity, efficiency and focus, often being able to handle many tasks without dropping or defaulting on any of them. They have limitless energy for their work and they produce more than favorable results. ENTJs often obtain what they go after because they are not easily discouraged, even when their plans or positions don’t seem to be working or take longer than expected. They believe they cannot fail. 

Strategic thinking. ENTJs are sharp thinkers and remarkable problem solvers. They tend to have great ideas and are able to examine the situation from every angle and strategically map out a plan in order to achieve their vision. Rather than being overwhelmed by problems, they are energized by them. These qualities combine with their strong conceptual skills to ensure that every project moves forward with smart, long-term solutions. 

Charismatic leaders. ENTJs live in a world of possibilities and see challenges everywhere that they gladly attack. They are leaders in the best sense, using their energy and charisma to inspire and motivate others. People often choose ENTJs be their leaders, and this allows ENTJs to achieve ambitious plans they could never achieve on their own. ","Blunt and dominant. Given their logical way of thinking, it's no surprise that ENTJs are expert at finding flaws and holes. But when combined with their characteristic bluntness and lack of regard for the feelings of others, it can make them appear critical, nitpicky and unrelenting. Not everyone will appreciate having their flaws so frequently picked out and put on display. 

Intolerant. ENTJs hold others to their same impossible standards, believing everyone can and should work as hard as they do. They often lack patience for people who are naturally less direct or a bit slower. “It’s my way or the highway” can be an intimidating mantra for those on the sharp end of the ENTJ’s criticism. 

Arrogant. ENTJs respect strategic thinking, quick wits and decisive action, and look down on those who don’t match up. While being sure of yourself can only be a good thing, it often translates to arrogance, especially in the eyes of those who have not put in as much effort and don’t have the same courage in their convictions. 

Poor handling of emotions. Empathy is not one of the strengths of the ENTJ. This type tends to be impatient when others refuse or are unable to see things from their perspective, and it requires active attention from the ENTJ to recognize the value of others' opinions and to take their feelings into account. In a personal environment, ENTJs can behave imperiously and trample over others’ feelings, which made not win them any friends. ","Get in touch with emotions—their own and others’. ENTJs can stand to intentionally work on raising their EQ a few points. Otherwise they come off as abrasive and unfeeling and their relationships fail to develop properly. ENTJs can make progress by working to consider their own feelings and those of other people, but it won’t come naturally. 

Practice restraint. Yes, it is important to be right, but this isn’t the only concern. It is important to also consider the personal consequences. Truth and results are important, but ENTJs will do well to consider how their actions and decisions will affect the people around them or society at large. 

Value people. Ideas, causes and convictions are important, but the ENTJ will be happier in the long run if he or she does not completely jettison personal relations and the feelings of others in the quest to be right or to hold to his or her convictions. And it is possible to enjoy the company and friendship of someone with whom one does not agree on all matters and who also doesn’t desire to argue about it. 

Listen up. ENTJs must work on listening and not just for the purpose of arguing in return. ENTJs, using their combination of intuition and rapid processing, tend to finish sentences, interrupt, anticipate information and make assumptions. They will benefit by slowing down, listening, waiting for others to finish and trying to pay attention to the details—they might actually be important. 

Relax! The pace of the ENTJ is rigorous and ENTJs often fail to see the need for leisure or rest. But their work schedule, high intensity and perfectionism can cause them to neglect their health and have negative consequences for them and their families. Thus, it is necessary to build leisure, fun, social interaction and rest into their lives without feeling guilty about the time they may be spending away from work. And they are likely to find that their work is better for it in the long run. ","THE COMMANDER
","ENTJs are drawn to leadership positions that allow them to develop strategies to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. They prefer to be in management or supervisory roles, and want the ability to initiate and lead organizational change.

ENTJs enjoy the challenge of solving difficult problems, and enjoy understanding complex systems so that they can determine where improvement is possible. ENTJs naturally see opportunities to improve systems, and want to lead teams to carry out their vision. They appreciate an environment where innovation is encouraged, and where traditions are not held sacred.

ENTJs want structure in their work. They prefer that their work and that of their colleagues be evaluated based on a set of clear guidelines. They appreciate an environment that is businesslike and fair, where performance is evaluated objectively and rewarded generously. ENTJs are typically motivated and hardworking, and want to be recognized for their efforts with money, power, and prestige.

An ideal organization for an ENTJ values competence and logical thinking, and includes coworkers who are intelligent and ambitious. An ideal job for an ENTJ is one that challenges them to address complex problems with strategic planning and clear goal-setting.","INTJ

ESFJ,"ESFJs are conscientious helpers, sensitive to the needs of others and energetically dedicated to their responsibilities. They are highly attuned to their emotional environment and attentive to both the feelings of others and the perception others have of them. ESFJs like a sense of harmony and cooperation around them, and are eager to please and provide.

ESFJs value loyalty and tradition, and usually make their family and friends their top priority. They are generous with their time, effort, and emotions. They often take on the concerns of others as if they were their own, and will attempt to put their significant organizational talents to use to bring order to other people's lives.","ESFJs act according to a strict moral code, and look for others to do the same. They often see things in terms of black and white, right and wrong, and they are typically not shy about sharing their evaluations of others' behavior. ESFJs seek harmony and cooperation, and feel this is best accomplished when everyone follows the same set of rules. They have a sense of order in the way people relate to one another, and often take on roles that allow them to help enforce that social order.

ESFJs feel a sense of personal responsibility for other people's needs, and are usually eager to get involved and help out. They tend to be serious and practical, dutifully putting business before pleasure—especially the business of caring for others. They typically enjoy routine and often keep a regular schedule that allows them to be organized and productive.","Strong practical skills. Good intentions are wonderful, but they don’t mean much unless they’re backed up by a well- organized plan of action. ESFJs understand how to accomplish tasks better than most, and that is why the to-do lists they make are seldom left with any unchecked items. They are so conscientious and detail-oriented they can’t stomach the thought of leaving an important job or project only half-finished, and they would feel embarrassed if they gave anything less than their very best effort in each and every instance.

Warm and sensitive. With grand and gentle hearts, ESFJs form lasting emotional bonds and make strong empathic connections with others. When someone needs guidance, ESFJs will be by their side, supporting them with advice that is concrete, sensible and guaranteed to produce good results. No problem is too big or too small to arouse the interest of ESFJs, and regardless of what a friend, loved one or acquaintance is going through, ESFJs will do their best to provide impactful assistance. 

Loyal and dutiful. ESFJs are traditionalists right down to the core. They are concerned with protecting the best parts of the existing social order against the forces of “progress”, and always honor the wisdom of their elders, always put the interests of others before their own. Doing the right thing every time doesn’t make life easy, but ESFJs are incapable of following the path of least resistance when people need help or moral issues are involved. 

Stand up and be counted. ESFJs aren’t intimidated by challenges and they aren’t willing to just sit by and wait for others to take the lead. Inside their social and community circles, ESFJs are always willing to step up and lend a helping hand; in support of great causes they will organize, volunteer, recruit, fundraise, run for election, put up flyers, go door-to-door or give speeches on street corners— sometimes all in the same week! ","Rigid and judgmental. While they are tolerant in general, ESFJs don’t approach the world with a completely open mind. Their value systems are defined by fixed ideas about right and wrong, good and bad, smart and foolish, and they tend to categorize everything they see according to such dualistic concepts. “Live and let live” is not a concept that appeals to ESFJs, who are not shy about judging the behavior and character of others based on brief initial impressions. 

Reluctant to improvise. ESFJs have a lot or respect for rules, laws, regulations and traditional codes of conduct—a world without shoulds and shouldn’ts and dos and don’ts would be unsustainable and chaotic to the traditionalist ESFJ. But in some instances, outside the box thinking may be required. ESFJs can be slow to recognize this reality, making them rigid and unyielding when a bit more openness to change is called for. 

Neediness. ESFJs have a strong need to be noticed, acknowledged and appreciated, and they want others to see them as helpful, trustworthy and virtuous. This means that their sense of self-worth will rise or fall based on the amount of praise or criticism they get from others. ESFJs aren’t worried about what other people will think every minute of the day, but they do take rejection very personally and have a hard time getting over any perceived slight. 

Lack of creative thinking. Too often, ESFJs are so focused on the here and now they miss opportunities for growth and improvement that are staring them right in the face. A long view that embraces creative inspirations, abstract ideas and big picture thinking can allow them to reach new levels of understanding, but taking their intellects in this direction does not come naturally to ESFJs. A failure to respect the benefits of creative power of the imagination can keep ESFJs stuck in patterns of thought and behavior that have long outlived their usefulness.","Get some emotional separation. Helping others gives ESFJs enormous satisfaction but, like sponges, they absorb the anxieties of others as if those troubles were their own. Unfortunately, this is emotionally exhausting and can put a huge strain on ESFJs who may become so preoccupied with the suffering and angst of their loved ones that they lose sight of their own personal needs. In the long run, ESFJs would be more effective if they could learn to put some emotional distance between themselves and the people they choose to assist. 

Practice “letting go”. Fish are going to swim, birds are going to fly, and ESFJs are going to make judgments about people and events based on their own exacting standards. But just because they possess this trait doesn’t mean they have to indulge it in every single instance. If ESFJs can learn to detach just a bit from their initial impressions, they will have a much easier time altering their judgments as more information comes in.

Remember that no one can please all of the people all of the time. ESFJs crave the favorable opinions of others and they always go the extra mile to please. But trying to satisfy everyone in every circumstance is impossible, no matter how friendly or accommodating an ESFJ might be. The sooner they realize this the better off they will be. Like anything else it takes practice to change attitudes, but learning to accept occasional rejection can help ESFJs find greater harmony and peace of mind. 

Practice solo hobbies. ESFJs can become overly dependent on other people, to the point where they feel ill-at-ease if there is no one around to talk to. We all need some alone time where we can reflect in peace and silence. Solitary hobbies and activities that require quiet concentration and promote self-reliance are highly recommended for ESFJs, who need to get in touch with their feelings and figure out how to get by without constant outside feedback. 

Learn a little more about how rules, laws, regulations and traditions actually came into being. ESFJs obey the rules and respect traditional ways. But rather than just accepting them without question, ESFJs should consider studying up to understand where they actually came from. Ideas we take for granted now were fresh and innovative at some point in the past, and they often represented a clean break from previous assumptions. Discovering where “self-evident truths” and “common sense” really came from can help ESFJs broaden their perspective. And if this makes them a little more open to new ideas in the present, it will be a positive development all the way around. ","THE PROVIDER
","ESFJs like to put their interpersonal skills to work to organize people and processes. They are tuned into the needs of others and seek to create structure to provide for people. ESFJs often prefer work that allows them to help people in practical, observable ways.

ESFJs enjoy work that allows them to follow through and see results, and prefer a high degree of structure and organization. They gain satisfaction from completing tasks with attention to order and detail. An ideal job for an ESFJ requires attention to procedure and specifications, and allows the ESFJ to work methodically to organize people and processes.

ESFJs usually prefer to work with others, and are energized by participating in a motivated, conscientious, action-oriented team. It is important to the ESFJ to do work that is accordant with their values, as well as to work with others who are supportive and cooperative. An ideal work environment for an ESFJ provides clear expectations and a friendly, structured atmosphere free from conflict or uncertainty.","ISFJ
